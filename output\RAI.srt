00:00:00, --> 00:00:11,231
Responsible ai is a governance framework that documents how a specific organization is addressing the challenges around artificial intelligence from both an ethical and legal point of view. 

2
00:00:11,231 --> 00:00:19,017
Resolving ambiguity for where responsibility lies if something goes wrong as an important driver for responsible ai initiatives. 

3
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:31,629
As of this writing the development of fair trustworthy ai standards is up to the discretion of the data scientists and software developers who write and deploy has pacific organizations ai algorithmic models. 

4
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:38,25
This means that the steps required to prevent discrimination and ensure transparency vary from company to company. 

5
00:00:38,25 --> 00:00:56,267
Justice title provided a common framework for delivering its services proponents of responsible today i hope that is widely adopted governance framework of ai best practices will make it easier for organizations around the globe to ensure their ai programming is human-centered interpretable and explainable. 

6
00:00:56,267 --> 00:01:06,339
In a large enterprise the chief analytics officer is typically tasked with developing implementing and monitoring the organizations responsible ai framework. 

7
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:17,487
Typically documented on the organization's website the framework explains in simple language how the organization addresses accountability and ensures their use of ai is auntie discriminatory. 

8
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:28,092
Why responsible ai is important responsible ai is an emerging area of ai governance and use of the word responsible is an umbrella term that covers both ethics and democratization. 

9
00:01:28,092 --> 00:01:38,939
The heads of microsoft and google have publicly called for anti regulations but as of this writing there are no standards for accountability when ai programming creates unintended consequences. 

10
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:44,677
Awesome bias can be introduced into a i buy the data that used to train machine learning models. 

11
00:01:44,677 --> 00:01:51,334
When the training data is biased it naturally follows the decisions made by the programming are also biased. 

12
00:01:51,334 --> 00:02:05,017
Now that software programs with artificial intelligence ai features are becoming more common it is increasingly apparent that there is a need for standards and ai beyond those established by isaac asimov in his three laws of robotics. 

13
00:02:05,017 --> 00:02:15,889
The technology can be misused accidentally or on purpose for a number of reasons and much of the misuse is caused by a bias in the selection of data to train ai programming. 

14
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:18,646
What are the principles of responsible ai. 

15
00:02:18,646 --> 00:02:24,845
Alien the machine learning models that supported should be comprehensive explainable ethical inefficient. 

16
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:32,635
Comprehensiveness comprehensive ai has clearly defined testing and governance criteria to prevent machine learning from being hacked easily. 

17
00:02:32,635 --> 00:02:41,492
Explainable ai is programmed to describe its purpose rationale and decision-making process in a way that can be understood by the average end user. 

18
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:48,128
Ethical ai initiatives have processes in place to seek out and eliminate bias in machine learning models. 

19
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:54,571
Efficient ai is able to run continually and respond quickly to changes in the operational environment. 

20
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:56,951
Why is responsible a important. 

21
00:02:56,951 --> 00:03:05,96
An important goal of responsible ai is to reduce the risk that a minor change in an input suede will drastically change the output of a machine learning model. 

22
00:03:05,96 --> 00:03:18,673
Within the context of conforming to the four tenets of corporate governance responsible ai should be each step of the model development process should be recorded in a way that cannot be altered by humans or other programming. 

23
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:22,259
The day that used to train machine model should not be biased. 

24
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:29,282
The analytic models that support an ai initiative can be adapted to changing environments without introducing bias. 

25
00:03:29,282 --> 00:03:35,482
The organization deployed ai programming is sensitive to its potential impact both positive and negative. 

26
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,129
How do you design responsible ai. 

27
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:42,4
Building a responsible ai governance framework can be a lot of work. 

28
00:03:42,4 --> 00:03:48,973
Ongoing scrutiny is crucial to ensure an organization is committed to providing an unbiased trustworthy ai. 

29
00:03:48,973 --> 00:03:56,715
This is why it is crucial for an organization to have a maturity model a rubric to follow while designing and implementing an ai system. 

30
00:03:56,715 --> 00:04:21,74
A base level to be considered responsible must be built with resources and technology according to a company-wide development standard that mandates the use of shared code repositories approved model architectures sanction variables established by his testing methodologies to help determine the validity of tests for ai system stability standards were active machine learning models to make sure ai programming works as intended.
